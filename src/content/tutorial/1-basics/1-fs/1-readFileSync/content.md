# Reading a file

Hey there, and welcome to your first Node.js lesson ðŸ‘‹!

In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to use the `fs` module.

The `fs` module is a built-in module in Node.js which provides an API for interacting with the file system. It provides methods for creating and deleting files and directories, reading and writing to files, and more.

We will learn how to read a file in Node.js using the `fs.readFileSync()` method which reads the contents of a file and returns it as a string. 

It takes two parameters: the path to the file and an encoding type.

The file we are going to is called `file.txt`, while the encoding type is `utf-8`.

For additional informations, please check out the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsreadfilesyncpath-options).
