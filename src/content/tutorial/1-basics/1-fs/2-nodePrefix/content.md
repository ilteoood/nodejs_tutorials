# The 'node:' prefix

The `fs` module is a built-in module in Node.js.

Node.js provides other built-in modules, like: `path`, `http`, `stream`...and many more.

Even if you can import those modules just by their naems, instead of doing so it's recommended to use the `node:` prefix.

The `node:` prefix is used to import Node.js built-in modules.

In this exercise, insert it before the `fs` module name.
